<p>Spirit, wake from your eternal slumber and enter the ruins of your once magnificent castle.</p>
                <p>Once this was a place of splendor full of life, now it lies in ruins. The emptyness yawns at you from
                    the corners and in the once fine halls only sparkles of dust dances to the sad tunes hummed by the
                    wind.
                    But now you are back to maybe start over. To rebuild what was lost centuries ago.
                </p>
                <p>And it's time to feed on the life of those who once fed on your death</p>
                <p>As you enter your castle you dig in your vague memories seemingly coming from an other world.
                    Certainly from an other life tough. </p>
